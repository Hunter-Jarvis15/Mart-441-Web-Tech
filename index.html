            <h2>So Who I am</h2>
            I'm a Junior at the University of Montana with the idea of getting into game design. I would like to be apart of the art creation side of game design over the coding side. I want to get into game design because I have always loved video games from an early age and I can thank my father for that. I think it's awesome that there is so much potential when creating a game.

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            I have some experience with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and After Effects. I also have some coding experience.

            <h2>Other Interests</h2>
            Some of my other hobbies include playing video games, ceramics, and wood working. I currently play Rocket League for the University of Montana on the JV team and have been enjoying it a lot. I'm currently in a ceramics class making pots on the wheel and am loving every minute of it. Wood working is something I would like to get into more in my free time. I think it's similar to ceramics in the way that I am using my hands to create something and it gives the impression of human touch and not factory.
