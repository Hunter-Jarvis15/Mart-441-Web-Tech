I decided to make a character creation choose your own adventure story. The premise was you start with two types of classes and choose weapons, an accesory and armor. I think it turned out well. My code happened to get pretty long and was starting to get confusing so I added comments to seperate out my code and so I would know what section was what. I enjoyed using JS to create this type of interaction with the user. In a sense the user is interacting with the person who created the code itself.
