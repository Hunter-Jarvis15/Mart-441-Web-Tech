Week 9 stumped me for a bit. The hint you gave us definitely helped and I was able to get some of my JSON file to show, but not all of it. When I ran my code and clicked the button I woudl get [object Object],.

I tried to single out just one section of my JSON file and then it worked and displayed the information, but I was unable to get all of file to  read the same way.
