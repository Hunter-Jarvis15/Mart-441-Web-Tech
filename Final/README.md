For our final I wanted to create a soothing animated background in HTML5. I had a lot of enjoyment with this project because I was able to explore a bit more bout HTML5. A lot of HTML5 is pretty close to P5.js which I know a bit about have taken Creative Coding 1 and 2, so it was more a matter of formatting towards HTML5. Overall I like the simplistic nature of my piece and I think I could stare at this all day.
