This weeks assignment was definitely a little challenging, but was built off of last weeks assignment which got the ball rolling a little bit. I got both the classes created and working properly along with the JSON files with the object information. I was able to the collision to work for the squares, but not my circles I created. When I used the hasCollided function it didn't seem to work with the circles and applied a weird hitbox to them. This was only thing I was unable to solve for this week.
