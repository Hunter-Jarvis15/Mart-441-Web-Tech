Homework 14 this week got a little harder trying to get everything running. I used the example code to get a better understanding of how everything worked together in three.js and it made more sense to me than following along online. Everything seemed to be going alright until I wanted to use my own model. I kept getting a type error that says "cannot set properties of undefined" and this is located in the STL Loader library.
